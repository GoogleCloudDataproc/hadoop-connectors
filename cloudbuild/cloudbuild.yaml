steps:
  # 1. Create a Docker image containing hadoop-connectors repo
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    id: 'docker-build'
    args: ['build', '--tag=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/dataproc-hadoop-connectors-presubmit', '-f', 'cloudbuild/Dockerfile', '.']

  # 2. Run unit tests
  - name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/dataproc-hadoop-connectors-presubmit'
    id: 'unit-tests'
    waitFor: ['docker-build']
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: ['/hadoop-connectors/cloudbuild/presubmit.sh', 'unittest']
    env:
      - 'CODECOV_TOKEN=$_CODECOV_TOKEN'

      - 'VCS_COMMIT_ID=$COMMIT_SHA'
      - 'VCS_TAG=$TAG_NAME'
      - 'CI_BUILD_ID=$BUILD_ID'

  # 3. Run integration tests concurrently with unit tests
  - name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/dataproc-hadoop-connectors-presubmit'
